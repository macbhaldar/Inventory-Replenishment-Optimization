# Inventory Replenishment Optimization for Warehouses (Python)
Designed EOQ-based and stochastic inventory policies, simulated warehouse operations, reduced stockouts while minimizing holding and ordering costs

## 1. Business Problem

Warehouses must balance:

Overstock → high holding and capital costs

Understock → stockouts, lost sales, poor service levels

### Goal:
Determine optimal reorder points (ROP) and order quantities (Q) that minimize total cost while achieving a target service level.

## 2. Business Objectives

Minimize total inventory cost

Maintain ≥95% service level

Reduce stockout probability

Provide actionable replenishment rules per SKU
